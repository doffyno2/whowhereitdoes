<p>The speed of sound is just over 760 miles per hour, and Mach 1 is the speed of sound, so Mach 3 is three times the speed of sound. While that may sound incredibly fast, and it certainly is, there are actually a few things that can travel at Mach 3 or faster. In this article, we will explore what these things are, and how fast they can go.</p>

<h2>What is Mach 3?</h2>

<p>Mach 3 is three times the speed of sound, or 2,280 miles per hour. It is the equivalent of 1,225 meters per second. It is considered a supersonic speed, and it is much faster than any commercial aircraft currently in service. Mach 3 is around the speed that a fighter jet can reach, and it is even faster than some of the fastest missiles.</p>

<h2>What Can Travel at Mach 3?</h2>

<p>There are a few things that can reach this incredible speed, some of which may surprise you. The obvious one is a jet fighter, which can reach up to Mach 3 in some cases. Some of the most advanced missiles can also reach this speed, and some of them are capable of even faster speeds. Even some of the most advanced rockets can reach this speed, although they are mostly used to reach space and not to travel within the atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Aircraft</h2>

<p>One of the most famous aircraft that can reach Mach 3 is the SR-71 Blackbird, a reconnaissance aircraft that was first developed in the 1960s. It was capable of reaching speeds of up to Mach 3.2 and was used for reconnaissance missions for many years. It was retired in 1998, but it still holds the record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft.</p>

<p>There are a few other aircraft that can reach Mach 3 or faster, such as the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft, the MiG-25 Foxbat, and the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31 Foxhound. These aircraft were all used during the Cold War and were designed to be fast and maneuverable. Most of these aircraft are no longer in service, but they are still impressive feats of engineering.</p>

<h2>Missiles</h2>

<p>One of the most advanced missiles that can reach Mach 3 is the Russian R-37M, which is an air-to-air missile. It has a range of up to 400 kilometers and is capable of reaching speeds of up to Mach 6. It is designed to be used in combat situations and is currently in service with the Russian Air Force.</p>

<p>Another missile that can reach Mach 3 is the American AGM-158 JASSM, which is an air-to-ground missile. It has a range of up to 900 kilometers and is capable of reaching speeds of up to Mach 3. It is designed to be used in combat situations and is currently in service with the US Air Force.</p>

<h2>Rockets</h2>

<p>Rockets are one of the few things that can reach speeds faster than Mach 3. The most famous example is the Saturn V rocket, which was used to send the Apollo missions to the Moon. It was capable of reaching speeds of up to Mach 8.5, which is much faster than any aircraft or missile. It is still the most powerful rocket ever built and is a testament to human engineering.</p>

<p>There are a few other rockets that can reach speeds of Mach 3 or faster, such as the Falcon Heavy, the Delta IV Heavy, and the Ariane 5. These rockets are all used for space exploration, and they are capable of reaching speeds much faster than any aircraft or missile.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As we can see, there are a few things that can reach speeds of Mach 3 or faster. Aircraft, missiles, and rockets are all capable of reaching this speed, although rockets are the only ones that can reach speeds faster than Mach 3. No matter what the vehicle, Mach 3 is an incredible speed and is a testament to human engineering.</p>
