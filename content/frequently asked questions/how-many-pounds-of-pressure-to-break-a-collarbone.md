Collarbone fractures, also known as clavicle fractures, are some of the most common injuries in the body. They occur when the clavicle, which connects the shoulder to the chest, is broken due to a traumatic force. The amount of force required to break a collarbone varies widely depending on the individual and the circumstances of the injury.

<h2>What Is a Collarbone?</h2>

The collarbone, or clavicle, is a long, thin bone located at the top of the chest area. It runs between the sternum and the shoulder blade, connecting the two. It is one of the most commonly fractured bones in the body and can occur due to a variety of causes.

<h2>Causes of Collarbone Fractures</h2>

Collarbone fractures can be caused by a variety of activities, including:
<ul>
<li>Falling on an outstretched arm</li>
<li>Receiving a direct blow to the shoulder</li>
<li>Twisting the shoulder or arm in an awkward position</li>
<li>Lifting a heavy object and placing too much strain on the shoulder</li>
<li>Falling onto a hard surface</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Collarbone Fractures</h2>

Collarbone fractures can be either a simple, or a complex fracture. A simple fracture is a break in the bone, while a complex fracture is a break in the bone, as well as damage to the surrounding tissue. A simple fracture is often treated with a sling, while a complex fracture may require surgery.

<h2>Symptoms of a Collarbone Fracture</h2>

Common signs and symptoms of a collarbone fracture include:
<ul>
<li>Pain in the shoulder or upper arm area</li>
<li>Swelling or bruising in the affected area</li>
<li>Tenderness in the affected area</li>
<li>Inability to move the arm or shoulder</li>
<li>Grating sensation when attempting to move the arm or shoulder</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosis of a Collarbone Fracture</h2>

If a collarbone fracture is suspected, a doctor will order an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. During the X-ray, the doctor will look for evidence of a fracture, as well as any displacement of the bone.

<h2>Treatment of a Collarbone Fracture</h2>

Treatment for a collarbone fracture depends on the type and severity of the break. For simple fractures, such as cracks in the bone, the doctor may recommend physical therapy to help strengthen the shoulder and arm muscles, as well as wearing a sling to keep the arm immobile. For more severe fractures, the doctor may recommend surgical intervention to realign the bones and repair any damage to surrounding tissue. 

<h2>What Is the Average Amount of Pressure Required to Break a Collarbone?</h2>

The amount of force required to break a collarbone can vary greatly depending on the individual and the circumstances of the injury. Generally speaking, it takes about 20-40 pounds of force to break a collarbone. However, this can vary depending on the age, size, and strength of the individual, as well as the type of force that is applied.
