<p>3 13 is a popular card game that can be enjoyed by two to four people. It is a great game for family gatherings and friendly get-togethers. The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards. The game requires a standard deck of 52 cards and can be played with two to four players. Here's how to play the game and become a 3 13 card game pro.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Dealing the Cards</h2>

<p>The first step is to deal the cards out to all the players. To do this, each player gets three cards, then a face down card is placed in the middle of the table. The remaining cards are then dealt out to each player in a clockwise manner until all the cards have been dealt. Everyone should now have thirteen cards.</p>

<h2>Step 2: The Play Begins</h2>

<p>The player to the left of the dealer goes first. They must begin by placing a card or a combination of cards from their hand onto the table. The card or combination must be the same suit as the card in the middle of the table. If the player has no cards of the same suit, then they must pass. If the player has a card or combination of cards with the same suit, then they must place it on the table.</p>

<p>Once the card or combination has been placed on the table, the next player in a clockwise direction must either match the card or combination or pass. This continues until all players have either passed or matched the card or combination. If all players pass, then the player who placed the card or combination collects all the cards on the table and places them in their pile. The next player then begins the next round.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Wild Cards</h2>

<p>Wild cards can be used when playing 3 13. A wild card is any card that can be used in place of any other card. This can be very useful if a player is stuck with a card they cannot match. The wild card can then be used to match the card or combination on the table.</p>

<p>The wild card can also be used to create combinations. For example, a player could place three sevens on the table, then use a wild card to create a four of a kind. As long as the wild card is of the same suit as the other cards, it can be used to make any combination.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Going Out</h2>

<p>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game. This is known as going out. A player can only go out if they have no cards left in their hand, and all the cards on the table have been matched or passed. As soon as a player has no cards left in their hand, they must announce that they are going out.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Scoring</h2>

<p>At the end of the game, each player's cards are counted up. The player with the fewest points wins the game. Each card is worth a certain number of points, with Ace being 1 point, 2-10 being their face value, and all face cards being 10 points. The player with the fewest points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>
