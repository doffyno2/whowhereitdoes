Water is one of the most essential nutrients for human life, but it can also be one of the priciest. Bottled water is a popular convenience item, but with prices ranging from a few cents to more than two dollars per bottle, it’s important to know what you’re paying for. Here, we’ll take a look at the different types of bottled water, what affects their price, and how much a bottle of water typically costs in 2018. 

<h2>Types of Bottled Water</h2>
When it comes to bottled water, there are several different types to choose from. The most common types are spring water, purified water, mineral water, and sparkling water. 

<h3>Spring Water</h3>
Spring water is sourced from natural springs and is usually bottled at the source. This type of water is known for its natural minerals and refreshing taste. It is usually slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.5-8.5. Spring water is also a good source of electrolytes, like calcium, sodium, and magnesium. 

<h3>Purified Water</h3>
Purified water is a type of bottled water that has been treated to remove impurities and contaminants. It is typically distilled, filtered, or processed through reverse osmosis. Purified water has a neutral pH of 7. 

<h3>Mineral Water</h3>
Mineral water is sourced directly from a mineral spring and must contain at least 250 parts per million of dissolved minerals. These minerals give the water its signature taste and can also provide health benefits. Mineral water is usually slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.5-8.5. 

<h3>Sparkling Water</h3>
Sparkling water is a type of carbonated water that has been infused with carbon dioxide gas. It can be naturally carbonated from a spring or artificially carbonated from tap water. Sparkling water is usually slightly acidic, with a pH of 5-7. 

<h2>Factors That Affect Price</h2>
There are several factors that can affect the price of bottled water. Some of the most common factors include the type of water, the source, the brand, the packaging, and the size of the bottle. 

<h3>Type of Water</h3>
The type of water can have a major impact on the price. Generally speaking, spring water and mineral water tend to be more expensive than purified and sparkling water. This is because spring water and mineral water are sourced from natural springs, while purified and sparkling water are typically sourced from tap water. 

<h3>Source</h3>
The source of the water can also have an impact on the price. Water that is sourced from natural springs tends to be more expensive than water that is sourced from tap water. This is because it takes more work and resources to collect and bottle water from natural springs. 

<h3>Brand</h3>
The brand of the bottled water can also affect its price. Generally speaking, well-known brands tend to be more expensive than generic brands. This is because these brands are typically associated with higher quality. 

<h3>Packaging</h3>
The packaging of the bottled water can also have an effect on the price. Water that is packaged in plastic bottles tends to be less expensive than water that is packaged in glass bottles. This is because plastic bottles are cheaper to produce and are more lightweight and durable. 

<h3>Size</h3>
The size of the bottle can also affect the price of the water. Generally speaking, larger bottles tend to be more expensive than smaller bottles. This is because it takes more resources to produce larger bottles and fill them with water.
