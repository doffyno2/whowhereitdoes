<p>Sometimes, dogs need a little bit of extra help to keep their anal gland healthy. These glands are located near the dog’s rectum and produce a smelly, oily liquid used for marking territory. If a dog’s anal glands become impacted or infected, it can be very uncomfortable for the pet. Fortunately, there is a natural remedy that can help keep the glands healthy and prevent future problems.</p>

<p>Pumpkin is a great source of fiber and can help maintain a healthy digestive system in dogs. The fiber in pumpkin helps to keep the stool soft and encourages regular bowel movements, which can help to naturally express the anal glands. Feeding your dog a small amount of canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) can help keep their anal glands healthy and prevent problems in the future.</p>
