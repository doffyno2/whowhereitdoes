<p>Fish is a nutritional, low-fat source of protein, and it is often a part of our diet. But because of its delicate nature, proper storage is essential to preventing spoilage and foodborne illness. So, when it comes to defrosted fish, how long can it stay in the fridge before it needs to be cooked or discarded?</p>

<h2>How Long Can Defrosted Fish Stay In The Refrigerator?</h2>

<p>Generally, defrosted fish can remain safe to eat for up to two days when stored in the refrigerator. This applies to both fresh and frozen fish. If the fish has been cooked, it can remain safe to eat for up to four days. It is important to note that this is only true if the fish is kept at a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below. If the temperature of the refrigerator is higher than 40 degrees, the fish should not be kept in it for more than one day.</p>

<p>When defrosting fish, it is important to defrost it in the refrigerator rather than on the countertop. The refrigerator will keep the fish cold enough to prevent it from spoiling, while the countertop may cause the fish to spoil more quickly. Additionally, it is important to keep the fish in an airtight container or a sealed bag to prevent any bacteria from contaminating it.</p>

<h2>Signs Of Spoiled Fish</h2>

<p>When it comes to knowing if your fish has gone bad, there are a few signs to look out for. If the fish has a slimy texture, a foul odor, or has changed color, it should be discarded. Additionally, if the fish has been sitting in its defrosted state for longer than two days, it should be discarded as well. </p>

<h2>How To Store Defrosted Fish</h2>

<p>The best way to store defrosted fish is in an airtight container or a sealed bag. This will help keep the fish cold and prevent any bacteria from contaminating it. It is also important to label the fish with the date it was defrosted so you can keep track of when it needs to be cooked or discarded. Additionally, make sure to place the fish at the bottom of the refrigerator or on the bottom shelf, as this will help keep it cold and prevent it from spoiling.</p>

<h2>Cooking Defrosted Fish</h2>

<p>When cooking defrosted fish, it is important to cook it thoroughly. Any portions of the fish that are still pink or raw should be cooked until they reach an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, make sure to cook the fish in an oil-based cooking method, such as frying or baking, as this will help to kill any bacteria that may be present.</p>
