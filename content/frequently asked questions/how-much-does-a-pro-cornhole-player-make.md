<p>Cornhole, also known as bean bag toss, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It’s a game that can be played casually with friends at cookouts or competitively at tournaments. At the highest level, some people have even turned cornhole into a career. But just how successful can a professional cornhole player be? How much does a pro cornhole player make?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends largely on the level of competition and the tournament prizes offered.
