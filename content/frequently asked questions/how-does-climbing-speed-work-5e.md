Climbing is a popular activity among adventurers in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. It can be used to traverse obstacles and gain access to areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. But there is more to climbing than simply shimmying up a wall. In this article, we’ll take a look at how climbing speed works in 5e and how it can be used to your advantage.

<h2>What is Climbing Speed?</h2>

Climbing speed is a measure of how quickly a character can climb an object or surface. It is affected by a character’s Strength score, as well as the type of surface they are attempting to climb. In 5e, some creatures have innate climbing speed, allowing them to climb surfaces with ease.

<h2>How is Climbing Speed Calculated?</h2>

The speed at which a character can climb is determined by their Strength score. A character with a higher Strength score will be able to climb quicker than a character with a lower Strength score.

In addition to Strength, the type of surface being climbed also affects the speed at which a character can climb. If a character is attempting to climb a smooth, slippery surface, their speed will be reduced. On the other hand, if they are climbing a rough, jagged surface, their speed will be increased.

<h2>What Skills Are Used for Climbing?</h2>

The Athletics skill is used for all climbing attempts. As a character’s Athletics skill increases, their climbing speed will also increase. This makes Athletics an important skill to invest in if your character wishes to climb quickly.

<h2>What are the Benefits of Climbing?</h2>

Climbing can be used to access areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. It can also provide an alternate route to a destination, allowing characters to bypass obstacles or enemies. Finally, climbing can be used as a way to surprise enemies, as characters can move quickly and silently while climbing.

<h2>What Equipment is Needed for Climbing?</h2>

Climbing requires very little in the way of equipment. A climbing harness, rope, and some form of protection (such as a helmet) are all that is needed. In addition, some surfaces may require specialized gear such as crampons or ice axes.

<h2>What are the Hazards of Climbing?</h2>

Climbing can be a dangerous activity. Characters must be careful to avoid slipping or falling, as this can lead to serious injury or even death. Additionally, some surfaces may contain hazards such as loose rocks or slippery surfaces that can make climbing difficult.
