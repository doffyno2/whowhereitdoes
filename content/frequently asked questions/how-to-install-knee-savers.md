Knee savers are a great tool for athletes, especially those who run or play sports that require a lot of running.

Installing a pair of knee savers is relatively straightforward, but it is important to do it correctly in order to ensure that they provide maximum support. In this guide, we will discuss the basics of installing knee savers and provide some helpful tips for getting the most out of them.

<h2>What Are Knee Savers?</h2>

Knee savers are small pads that provide additional support and cushioning to the knee joint. They are usually made of a foam material and are designed to fit snugly around the knee, providing extra protection against impact and helping to reduce the risk of injury. Knee savers are popular among athletes who run or play sports that involve a lot of running, as they can help to improve performance and reduce the risk of knee injuries.

<h2>Why Do You Need Knee Savers?</h2>

Knee savers are a great way to provide extra support and cushioning to the knee joint, reducing the risk of injury and helping to improve performance. Knee savers can help to reduce the impact on the knee joint when running, which can lead to fewer injuries and improved performance. They can also provide extra stability, helping to keep the knee joint in the correct position and aiding with balance and agility. 

<h2>How to Install Knee Savers</h2>

Installing knee savers is relatively straightforward, but it is important to do it correctly in order to ensure that they provide maximum support. Here are the steps to follow when installing knee savers:

<h3>Step 1: Measure Your Knees</h3>

The first step is to measure your knees so that you can find the right size of knee savers. Measure the circumference of your knee in inches and make sure to measure both knees in order to ensure that you get the right size.

Once you have measured your knees, it is time to choose the right size of knee savers. Make sure to get the size that corresponds to the measurements of your knees. If you are in between sizes, it is better to go for a larger size as this will provide more support and cushioning. 

<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Knee Savers</h3>

Before installing the knee savers, it is important to make sure that they are prepared correctly. Start by cleaning the knee savers with a damp cloth to remove any dirt or debris. Then, use a hairdryer to heat up the knee savers so that they are warm and pliable.

<h3>Step 4: Apply the Knee Savers</h3>

Once the knee savers are warm, they should be ready to be applied. Start by placing the knee savers around the knee, making sure that the pad is evenly distributed around the knee joint. Then, press down firmly on the knee savers to ensure that they are firmly attached, and use a hairdryer to heat up the knee savers again to make sure that they are firmly attached.

<h3>Step 5: Check for Comfort</h3>

Once the knee savers have been installed, it is important to check for comfort. Make sure that the knee savers feel comfortable and that they are providing enough support and cushioning. If they are too tight or too loose, you may need to adjust them or purchase a different size.
