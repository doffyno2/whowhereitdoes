<p>The Infiniti Q50 is a luxury sedan designed and manufactured by Japanese automaker Nissan. The car features a powerful engine, sleek exterior, and a comfortable interior. However, like all vehicles, it needs regular maintenance in order to keep it running properly. Here is a guide to resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Oil Level</h2>

<p>The first step in resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50 is to check the oil level. To do this, open the hood and locate the oil dipstick. Pull the dipstick out and check the oil level. If it is low, top it up with the appropriate type of oil. Make sure to check the owner's manual to find out what type of oil is recommended for your vehicle.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Check the Air Filter</h2>

<p>The second step in resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50 is to check the air filter. The air filter is responsible for ensuring that the engine is supplied with clean air. If the filter is dirty, it can affect the performance of the engine. To check the air filter, open the air filter housing and inspect the filter. If it is dirty, replace it with a new one.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Replace the Spark Plugs</h2>

<p>The third step in resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50 is to replace the spark plugs. Spark plugs are responsible for providing the spark that ignites the fuel in the engine. If the spark plugs are worn out, the engine may not run as efficiently as it should. To replace the spark plugs, you will need to purchase new spark plugs from your local auto parts store. Once you have the new spark plugs, install them according to the instructions in the owner's manual.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Change the Oil</h2>

<p>The fourth step in resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50 is to change the oil. Oil is responsible for lubricating the engine and keeping it running smoothly. Over time, the oil can become contaminated with dirt and other particles, which can reduce its effectiveness. To change the oil, you will need to purchase new oil from your local auto parts store. Once you have the new oil, drain the old oil, replace the filter, and fill the engine with the new oil.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The last step in resetting the maintenance on your Infiniti Q50 is to reset the maintenance light. The maintenance light will come on when it is time to perform maintenance on your vehicle. To reset the light, turn the ignition key to the “on” position and press and hold the “reset” button for approximately five seconds. Once the light has been reset, it will no longer come on when it is time to perform maintenance.</p>
