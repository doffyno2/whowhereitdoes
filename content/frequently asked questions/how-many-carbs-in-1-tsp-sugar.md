<h2>The Amount of Carbs in 1 tsp of Sugar</h2>

<p>The exact amount of carbohydrates in 1 tsp of sugar varies depending on the type of sugar. When it comes to white table sugar, 1 tsp contains 4.2 g of carbohydrates. This is equivalent to around 16 calories. Brown sugar contains slightly more carbohydrates, with 1 tsp containing 4.7 g.</p>

<h2>Carbohydrates in Other Types of Sugar</h2>

<p>Other types of sugar, such as honey, maple syrup, agave nectar, and molasses contain varying amounts of carbohydrates. For example, 1 tsp of honey contains 5.6 g of carbohydrates, while 1 tsp of maple syrup contains 5.2 g. Agave nectar contains 6.8 g per tsp and molasses contains 7.3 g per tsp.</p>

<h2>The Nutritional Value of Sugar</h2>

Foods with a high glycemic index cause our blood sugar levels to rise quickly, while foods with a low glycemic index cause our blood sugar levels to rise slowly. On the glycemic index, white sugar has a score of 65, while brown sugar has a slightly higher score of 68. Honey has a score of 55, maple syrup has a score of 54, agave nectar has a score of 15, and molasses has a score of 55.</p>
