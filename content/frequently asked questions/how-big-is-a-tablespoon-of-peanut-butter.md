<p>Most people have a general idea of how big a tablespoon is, but when it comes to specific measurements, like a tablespoon of peanut butter, the size can be a bit tricky to figure out. Peanut butter is a common ingredient in many recipes, so it’s important to measure it accurately for the best results. Read on to discover how big a tablespoon of peanut butter is and how to measure it correctly.</p>

<h2>What Is a Tablespoon?</h2>

<p>Before diving into how much peanut butter is in a tablespoon, it’s important to know what a tablespoon is. A tablespoon is the most commonly used unit of volume measurement in the U.S., and it is equal to three teaspoons or 15 milliliters. It’s a measurement of volume, not weight, so it’s a good idea to measure your ingredients in tablespoons rather than guessing the weight.</p>

<h2>How Much Is a Tablespoon of Peanut Butter?</h2>

<p>The exact amount of peanut butter in a tablespoon will depend on the type of peanut butter and the brand. Generally, a tablespoon of creamy peanut butter is equal to 16 grams, or 0.56 ounces. For crunchy peanut butter, a tablespoon is equal to 14 grams, or 0.49 ounces. It’s important to note that this is the weight of the peanut butter, not the volume.</p>

<h2>How Do You Measure a Tablespoon of Peanut Butter?</h2>

<p>Measuring peanut butter can be tricky because of its sticky consistency. To measure a tablespoon of peanut butter accurately, it’s best to use a standard measuring spoon. Scoop the peanut butter into the spoon until it is heaped over the top. Then, use a knife or the back of a spoon to level the peanut butter off so that it’s even with the top of the spoon. This will give you an exact tablespoon measurement.</p>

<h2>Can You Measure Peanut Butter Without a Measuring Spoon?</h2>

<p>If you don’t have a measuring spoon on hand, you can still measure a tablespoon of peanut butter. Start by scooping up a tablespoon amount with a regular spoon. Then, use your finger to level off the top so that the peanut butter is even with the top of the spoon. This will give you an approximate tablespoon measurement.</p>

<h2>How Many Calories Are in a Tablespoon of Peanut Butter?</h2>

<p>The number of calories in a tablespoon of peanut butter will vary depending on the type and brand. Generally, a tablespoon of creamy peanut butter contains about 90 to 100 calories, while a tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter contains about 90 calories. It’s important to note that this is for a tablespoon, not a cup, which contains about 725 calories.</p>

<h2>Tips for Measuring Peanut Butter</h2>

<p>Measuring peanut butter accurately is the key to getting the best results in recipes. Here are some tips to keep in mind when measuring peanut butter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a standard measuring spoon for accuracy.</li>
  <li>Level off the peanut butter with a knife or spoon for exact measurements.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have a measuring spoon, use a regular spoon and level off the top with your finger.</li>
  <li>Be mindful of the calories in peanut butter. A tablespoon is not the same as a cup.</li>
</ul>
