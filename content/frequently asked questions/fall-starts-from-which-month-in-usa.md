Fall is one of the four seasons of the year in the United States. It is the season that follows summer and precedes winter. Fall is a time for harvesting crops, changing colors of leaves, and enjoying the cool breeze. But when does it start?

<h2>What Month Does Fall Begin in the United States?</h2>

The months of September, October, and November are considered fall in the United States. The official start of fall is the autumnal equinox, which falls on either September 22 or 23. This is when the sun passes directly over the equator, creating nearly equal amounts of day and night.

<h2>What are the Different Types of Fall?</h2>

Fall in the United States can be divided into three distinct parts: early fall, mid-fall, and late fall. Early fall is typically considered September, while mid-fall is usually October, and late fall is November. Each of these parts of the season has its own distinct characteristics.

<h3>Early Fall</h3>

Early fall is the time when the leaves on the trees start to change color, bringing with it cooler temperatures and shorter days. It's also the time when most crops are harvested, and the air is filled with the smell of freshly baked goods.

<h3>Mid-Fall</h3>

Mid-fall is when the leaves have changed color to their fullest and the temperatures start to drop even further. This is when you can expect to see the most beautiful fall foliage and enjoy the cooler temperatures.

<h3>Late Fall</h3>

Late fall is the time when the leaves start to fall off the trees and the temperatures continue to drop. This is also the time when winter starts to creep in, and the days get shorter and shorter.

<h2>What Activities are Common During Fall?</h2>

Many people enjoy fall for its cooler temperatures and changing colors. There are many activities that people enjoy during this season, including apple picking, pumpkin carving, leaf-raking, hayrides, and more.

<h3>Apple Picking</h3>

Apple picking is a popular activity during fall. Many people enjoy going to apple orchards and picking their own apples, while others enjoy buying apple pies, apple cider, and more from the orchards.

<h3>Pumpkin Carving</h3>

Pumpkin carving is another popular activity during the fall season. Many people enjoy carving pumpkins and displaying them on their front porches. Some even compete in pumpkin carving competitions.

<h3>Leaf-Raking</h3>

Leaf-raking is an activity that many people enjoy during the fall season. It involves raking up the leaves that have fallen from the trees, which can be a fun and rewarding activity.
