Dead by Daylight (DBD) is a survival horror video game developed by Behaviour Interactive and released in 2016. It has become a very popular game among gamers and has millions of players worldwide. As the players progress through the game, they often find themselves in difficult situations where they need to make quick decisions in order to survive. One of these situations is camping, which is when a player stays in one spot for too long and does not move around. If a player camps for too long, they can be disconnected from the game and their progress will be lost. This article will discuss how long a player can camp before they get disconnected from DBD, as well as strategies to avoid camping too long.

Camping in Dead by Daylight is when a player stays in one spot for too long and does not move around.

Camping is discouraged because it can be used as a way to gain an unfair advantage over other players. 

<h2>What Are the Risks of Camping in Dead by Daylight?</h2>

The main risk of camping in Dead by Daylight is that you can get disconnected from the game. If a player camps for too long, the game will automatically disconnect them and their progress will be lost.

<h2>What Are Some Strategies to Avoid Camping Too Long in Dead by Daylight?</h2>

One of the best ways to avoid camping too long in Dead by Daylight is to move around frequently.
