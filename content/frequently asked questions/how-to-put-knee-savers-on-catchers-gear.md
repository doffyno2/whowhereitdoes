<p>Catcher's gear is an essential piece of equipment for any catcher, whether it's in Little League or in the Major Leagues. It's designed to protect the catcher's body from the impact of a hard-thrown ball, as well as to help him manage the game from behind the plate. But catcher's gear can be a bit of a pain to put on, especially when it comes to the knee savers. Knee savers are designed to protect the catcher's knees from the impact of a hard-thrown ball, but they can be tricky to put on. Here's how to put knee savers on catchers gear so you can get back to playing the game.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Lay Out Your Gear</h2>

<p>Before you start putting on your knee savers, it's important to make sure that your catchers gear is properly laid out in front of you. You should have your leg guards, chest protector, mask, and knee savers, all laid out in the order that you'll be putting them on. This will make it easier to see where each piece goes, and help you figure out how to put them on.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Put On Your Leg Guards</h2>

<p>The first step in putting on your catchers gear is to put on your leg guards. Start by putting your left foot in the leg guard and then pull it up your leg until it fits snugly. Once it's in place, make sure to tighten the straps so that it doesn't move when you're running. Then repeat the same process for your right leg.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Put On Your Chest Protector</h2>

<p>Once your leg guards are in place, you can move on to putting on your chest protector. Start by putting your arms through the arm holes and then pull it up until it fits snugly against your chest. Once it's in place, make sure to tighten the straps so that it doesn't move when you're running.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Put On Your Mask</h2>

<p>Once your chest protector is in place, you can move on to putting on your mask. Start by putting the top of the mask over your head, and then pull it down until it fits snugly against your face. Once it's in place, make sure to tighten the straps so that it doesn't move when you're running.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Put On Your Knee Savers</h2>

<p>The last step in putting on your catchers gear is to put on your knee savers. Start by putting the top of the knee savers over your knees, and then pull them down until they fit snugly against your legs. Make sure to tighten the straps so that they don't move when you're running. Once they're in place, you're ready to get back behind the plate.</p>
