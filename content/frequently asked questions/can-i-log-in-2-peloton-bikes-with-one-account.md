<p>Peloton is one of the most popular at-home fitness solutions, and its bikes and treadmills have gained a lot of popularity in recent years. But if you're wondering if you can log in two Peloton bikes with one account, the answer is no. Peloton only allows one user to log in per bike.</p> 

<p>Peloton's policy is to only allow one user to be logged in at a time on each bike. This is to ensure that each user gets the best experience possible when using the bike. If multiple users were logged in, it would be difficult for the bike to track progress and give feedback accurately.</p>

<p>While you can't log in two Peloton bikes with one account, there is a way to have multiple users on one bike. You can have up to four users set up on a single bike. Each user will have their own profile and will be able to access their own workouts and progress. This can be a great option for couples or families that want to use the same bike.</p>

<p>To set up multiple users on one bike, you'll need to create a new account for each user. You can either use the same email address for all of the accounts or create different ones. Once the accounts have been created, you can then link them to the bike. To do this, you'll need to open the settings menu and go to the "My Profile" section. From here, you can add or remove users from the bike.</p> 

<p>It's important to note that each user will need to purchase their own subscription in order to access all of the features of the Peloton app. If you're looking to save money, you can purchase a multi-user subscription. This will allow multiple users to access the Peloton app and the bike at the same time, but at a discounted rate.</p>
