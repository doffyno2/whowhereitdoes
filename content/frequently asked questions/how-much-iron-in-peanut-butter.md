Peanut butter is one of the most popular spreads in the world. It can be found in nearly every pantry and is beloved by both children and adults alike.

Not only is it a good source of protein, but peanut butter also contains a healthy dose of iron. In this article, we'll discuss how much iron is in peanut butter and how it can benefit your health.

<h2>What is Iron?</h2>

Iron is an essential mineral that is needed by the body to create hemoglobin, which is a protein that helps carry oxygen throughout the body. It also helps your muscles store and use oxygen, which is essential for energy production. Iron is found in many foods, including red meat, legumes, eggs, and dark leafy greens. It is important to get enough iron in your diet since a deficiency can lead to anemia, fatigue, and other health problems.

Peanut butter is a good source of iron, with one tablespoon containing 0.37 milligrams. That may not seem like a lot, but it can still make a significant contribution to your daily iron intake. For example, if you ate four tablespoons of peanut butter per day, you'd get 1.48 milligrams of iron. This is nearly 10 percent of the recommended daily value for adults.
