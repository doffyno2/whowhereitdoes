The United States of America and the Russian Federation share a large border of land, connected by the Bering Sea. The two nations have a long history that dates back to the 1700s, when Russian fur traders began to explore the northernmost parts of North America. Since then, the two countries have had a complicated relationship, which has been tested by a number of international events, including the Cold War and the recent reunification of Crimea with Russia.

Despite the complicated history between the two countries, the two nations remain connected by one of the longest borders in the world: the United States-Russia border, which spans 4,592 miles along the Bering Sea. This border, which divides the two countries, begins at the Chukchi Sea in Siberia and stretches all the way across the Bering Strait to the Alaskan coast.
