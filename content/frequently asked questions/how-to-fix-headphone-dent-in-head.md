<p>It can be extremely irritating when you are wearing headphones and you find that the band has left a dent in your head.

Fortunately, there are a few methods you can use to fix the dent caused by headphones. Here is how you can fix headphone dent in head.</p>

<h2> Using Heat to Fix the Dent</h2>

<p>One of the simplest and quickest ways to fix headphone dent in head is to use heat. Heat can help to relax the muscles and tissues in the area, which can help reduce the appearance of the dent.

You should also avoid using a hairdryer on the highest heat setting, as this could cause further damage to the head.</p>
