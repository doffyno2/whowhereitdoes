When it comes to surviving in the harsh environment of the Escape from Tarkov game, one of the most important tools you can have is a flashlight. A flashlight can help you search for items, find your way in the dark, and even ward off enemies. But how do you use a flashlight in Tarkov? 

<h2>How to Equip a Flashlight in Tarkov</h2>

Equipping a flashlight in Tarkov is fairly simple. To do so, open your inventory and select the thing you want to equip.

<h2>Different Types of Flashlights in Tarkov</h2>

When it comes to flashlights in Tarkov, there are a few different types to choose from. Each type of flashlight has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few of the most popular types of flashlights in Tarkov:

Tactical flashlights are a popular choice for players who want a reliable and powerful light source. These flashlights typically have a high-powered LED light and are designed to be durable and lightweight. They are also usually small enough to fit in your pocket, making them easy to carry around. 

<h3>Headlamps</h3>

Headlamps are another popular choice for players who want a hands-free light source. These flashlights strap onto your head and provide a powerful beam of light. They are also lightweight and easy to carry. The downside of headlamps is that they can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. 

<h3>Floodlights</h3>

Floodlights are a great choice for players who want a powerful light source with a wide range. These lights typically have a wide beam of light that can illuminate a large area. The downside of floodlights is that they are usually bulky and heavy, making them difficult to carry around. 

<h2>Tips for Using a Flashlight in Tarkov</h2>
