<h2>What You Need to Make a Villager Follow You</h2>

You can find villagers in villages, or you can spawn them using a spawn egg. Once you've found a villager, you need to trade with it. You can trade emeralds for the items the villager is offering. Once you've finished trading, you need to give the villager the food you have. If the villager accepts the food, it will start to follow you. You can then lead the villager to where you want it to go. Once you've arrived at your destination, you can tell the villager to stay there by right-clicking on it.</p>
