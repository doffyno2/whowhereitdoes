<p>When winter strikes, staying warm is the top priority, but it's just as important to keep all bottled water from freezing. Even though bottles of water are sold in stores all year round, freezing temperatures can cause them to expand and even burst. While this won't necessarily harm you, it can cause a mess and be quite expensive. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to ensure your bottled water remains unfrozen, no matter how cold it gets outside.</p>

<h2>1. Store Bottled Water in a Cool, Dry Place</h2>

<p>The best way to keep bottled water from freezing is to store it in a cool, dry place. Ideally, bottled water should be kept at a temperature of 40°F or less. To achieve this, store your bottled water in a basement, garage, or other unheated area of your home. You may also want to invest in a mini-fridge or wine cooler to keep your bottled water at a consistent temperature.</p>

<h2>2. Insulate Your Bottled Water</h2>

<p>If you don't have access to a cool, dry place for storing your bottled water, you can insulate it with some simple materials. Wrapping your bottled water in newspaper or bubble wrap will help keep it from freezing. You can also purchase special insulated containers specifically designed for keeping bottled water from freezing.</p>

<h2>3. Add a Heat Source</h2>

<p>If you're still having trouble keeping your bottled water from freezing, adding a heat source can help. A few candles placed near the bottles of water will provide enough heat to keep them from freezing. You can also use a space heater or electric blanket to keep the area around your bottled water warm.</p>

<h2>4. Keep the Bottles Sealed</h2>

<p>Finally, make sure to keep the bottles of water tightly sealed at all times. Even small amounts of air can cause the water to freeze faster. If you notice that the bottles are starting to expand, be sure to open them up and release any excess air before resealing them.</p>
