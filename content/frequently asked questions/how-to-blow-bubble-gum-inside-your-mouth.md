<p>Bubble gum is a fun and tasty way to enjoy yourself, and blowing bubbles is one of the most rewarding types of bubble gum activities. But, if you’ve never tried to blow a bubble inside your mouth, it can be a bit intimidating. In this article, we’ll explain the proper way to blow bubble gum inside your mouth.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need:</h2>

<p>In order to blow a bubble inside your mouth, you’ll need some bubble gum and a straw. The straw should be wide enough to fit over the bubble gum without blocking it. You also need a container to catch the bubble gum when it pops.</p>

<h2>Step One: Put the Bubble Gum in Your Mouth</h2>

<p>Take a small piece of bubble gum and place it in the center of your mouth. Make sure it is close to the back of your tongue. You’ll want to be able to move it around easily so don’t put too much in your mouth at once.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Form the Bubble</h2>

<p>Once you have the bubble gum in your mouth, use your tongue to shape it into a bubble. Be sure not to pop it! If you do, you’ll need to start over with a new piece of bubble gum. To make sure the bubble is shaped properly, use the straw to gently blow into the center of the bubble.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Blow the Bubble</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve formed the bubble, it’s time to blow it up. Use the straw to gently blow into the center of the bubble. You should be able to feel the air filling the bubble. Once it is full, gently move the bubble to the side of your mouth and release it.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Catch the Bubble</h2>

<p>As soon as the bubble pops, use the container to catch the bubble gum. This will help keep your mouth clean and also make it easier to start a new bubble. Make sure to put the bubble gum back in the container and not on the floor.</p>
