The majestic Mount Everest is the highest peak on earth, and it has been a source of inspiration, awe, and wonder for centuries. From climbers who attempt to summit the peak, to those who simply admire its grandeur from afar, the mountain has been a source of fascination for many. But how tall is Mount Everest?

The exact height of Mount Everest has been a subject of some debate over the years. This is because different measurements have been taken from different points, and the exact height can vary depending on the source. In this article, we will look at the various measurements of Mount Everest and compare them to one another.

<h2>Official Height Measurements of Mount Everest</h2>

The official height of Mount Everest is 8,848 meters (29,029 feet). This measurement was determined by the Survey of India in 1954, and is the most commonly accepted figure. This measurement was taken from the top of the rock pyramid at the summit of the peak.

However, some other measurements have been taken over the years. In 1999, a GPS measurement was taken which put the height at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet). This figure was confirmed by China in 2005, and is now accepted as the official height in China.

<h2>Height Measurements Based on Snow and Ice Cover</h2>

When measuring the height of Mount Everest, it is important to take into account the fact that the peak is covered with snow and ice. This can affect the overall height of the peak, as the snow and ice can add an additional few meters to the total height.

The most commonly accepted figure for the height of Mount Everest based on snow and ice cover is 8,848.86 meters (29,029.84 feet). This figure was determined by the National Geographic Society in 1999, and is accepted as the official measurement in Nepal.

<h2>Height Measurements Based on Rock Pyramid</h2>

The rock pyramid at the summit of Mount Everest is the highest point of the peak. As such, the height of the mountain can be measured from the top of the rock pyramid. This is the most accurate way to measure the height of the peak, as it takes into account the snow and ice cover, as well as the height of the rock pyramid itself.

The most commonly accepted figure for the height of Mount Everest based on the rock pyramid is 8,848.2 meters (29,028.9 feet). This figure was determined by the Survey of India in 1954, and is accepted as the official measurement in India.
