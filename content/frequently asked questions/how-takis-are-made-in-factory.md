How Takis are Made in Factory

Takis are a popular Mexican snack food that has become an international sensation. They are made from corn flour and masa, which is a corn-based dough. The dough is then fried, seasoned, and rolled into small balls. Takis are known for their intense flavor and spicy kick, and they’re loved by people of all ages.

But have you ever wondered how Takis are made in a factory? In this article, we’ll explore the process of manufacturing Takis.


Takis are made from several key ingredients. The main ingredients are corn flour, masa, and salt. Corn flour is a finely ground flour that is made from dried and ground corn kernels. Masa, on the other hand, is a corn-based dough that is made by grinding whole corn kernels into a fine powder.

To give Takis their signature flavor, the dough is then seasoned with a blend of spices, including chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika. The combination of these spices gives Takis their distinctive flavor and heat.


The first step in the manufacturing process is to mix the ingredients together to create the dough. The corn flour, masa, and salt are mixed together in a large bowl. Once the ingredients are combined, the dough is kneaded until it is smooth and pliable.

Once the dough is ready, it is portioned into small balls. The portion size depends on the size of Takis being produced. The balls of dough are then flattened into thin discs.

Next, the discs of dough are placed into a deep fryer and fried until they are golden brown. Once fried, the Takis are removed from the fryer and allowed to cool.


Once the Takis have cooled, they are ready to be seasoned. The Takis are placed in a large bowl and then tossed with the spice mixture. The mixture is made up of chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, and other spices. This is what gives Takis their signature flavor and heat.

After the Takis are seasoned, they are ready to be packaged. The Takis are placed in resealable bags and then sealed shut. From there, the bags are then placed into boxes and shipped to stores.
