<p>In Scum, a survival game created by Gamepires, you will need to manage your inventory to survive. One of the most important parts of inventory management is learning how to rotate items in your backpack. This can be done in a few different ways, depending on what kind of item you want to rotate and how much space you need to work with. Here we will explain the different ways of rotating items and how to do so in Scum.</p>

<h2>Rotating Larger Items in Your Backpack</h2>

<p>The first and most important thing when rotating larger items in your backpack is to make sure that you have enough space to actually fit the item in. If you do not have enough space, then it is impossible to rotate the item. You can check the size of the item by hovering your mouse over the item in your inventory and looking at the details. Once you know the size, then you can look for empty spaces in your backpack that are at least the same size as the item.</p>

<p>Once you have found a space that is big enough for the item, then you can start to rotate it. To do this, you will need to hover your mouse over the item and press the ‘R’ key. This will open up a small menu allowing you to rotate the item clockwise or counter-clockwise. Once the item has been rotated to the desired position, you can hit the ‘Enter’ key to confirm the rotation and the item will be placed in the backpack.</p>

<h2>Rotating Smaller Items in Your Backpack</h2>

<p>Rotating smaller items in your backpack is a bit more complicated than rotating larger items because they are much harder to fit into small spaces. The first thing you should do is check the size of the item by hovering your mouse over it in your inventory and looking at the details. Once you know the size, then you can start looking for empty spaces in your backpack that are at least the same size as the item.</p>

<p>Once you have found a space that is big enough for the item, then you can start to rotate it. To do this, you will need to hover your mouse over the item and press the ‘R’ key. This will open up a small menu allowing you to rotate the item clockwise or counter-clockwise. Once the item has been rotated to the desired position, you can hit the ‘Enter’ key to confirm the rotation and the item will be placed in the backpack.</p>

<p>If you find that the item is too large to fit into a single space, then you can try to rotate it in two or more smaller spaces. To do this, you will need to find two or more empty spaces that are large enough for the item and then rotate the item in each of them until it fits into the desired position. This can be a bit tricky, as you need to make sure that all of the spaces are big enough for the item and that the item is rotated correctly in each of them.</p>

<h2>Rotating Multiple Items at Once</h2>

<p>If you have multiple items that you need to rotate in your backpack, then it can be a bit tricky to do so. The first thing you should do is check the size of each item by hovering your mouse over it in your inventory and looking at the details. Once you know the size of each item, then you can start looking for empty spaces in your backpack that are at least the same size as the items.</p>

<p>Once you have found spaces that are big enough for the items, then you can start to rotate them. To do this, you will need to hover your mouse over each item and press the ‘R’ key. This will open up a small menu allowing you to rotate each item clockwise or counter-clockwise. Once all of the items have been rotated to the desired positions, you can hit the ‘Enter’ key to confirm the rotation and the items will be placed in the backpack.</p>
