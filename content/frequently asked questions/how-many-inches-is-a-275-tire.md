<p>Tire sizes can be confusing, especially when you don’t know how to read the letters and numbers. If you’re looking for a tire size for your vehicle and you see a number like 275, you might be wondering how many inches is a 275 tire. The good news is that it’s easy to figure out the size of a tire based on its designation.</p>

<h2>How to Read a Tire Size</h2>

<p>When looking at a tire size designation, the first number indicates the width of the tire in millimeters. The 275 designation means that the tire width is 275 millimeters or 10.83 inches. This width is measured from one sidewall to the other, not across the tread.</p>

<p>The second number indicates the aspect ratio of the tire. This is the height of the sidewall expressed as a percentage of the width. In the case of a 275 tire, the aspect ratio is 70%. This means that the sidewall of the tire is 70% of the width, or 7.6 inches.</p>

<p>The third number is the rim size. This is the diameter of the wheel that the tire is designed to fit. In this case, the rim size is 17 inches.</p>
