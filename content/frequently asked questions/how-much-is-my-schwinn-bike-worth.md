Founded in 1895, the company has since produced some of the most iconic bicycles of all time, and continues to produce some of the most popular bicycles on the market today. But how much is a Schwinn bike worth?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors, including the type and condition of the bike, as well as the current market value.
