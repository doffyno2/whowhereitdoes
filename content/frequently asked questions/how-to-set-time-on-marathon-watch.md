<p>Are you having trouble trying to set the time on your Marathon watch? Setting the time on your Marathon watch is a fairly simple process, and it takes only a few minutes. In this article, we'll go over the steps to setting the time on your Marathon watch, so you can get back to telling time in style.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Set Time on Your Marathon Watch</h2>

<p>Before you can get started, you'll need a few items to get the job done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Marathon watch</li>

<h2>Step-By-Step Instructions on Setting Time on Your Marathon Watch</h2>

<p>Now that you have all the necessary items, here are the steps to setting the time on your Marathon watch:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unscrew the crown of the watch.</li>
  <li>If the watch has a screw-down crown, use a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew it. Once you've unscrewed the crown, gently pull it away from the watch.</li>
  <li>Use the crown to adjust the time.</li>
  <li>Turn the crown clockwise to increase the time and counterclockwise to decrease it. It's best to make small adjustments, as it's easy to overshoot the desired time.</li>
  <li>Once you've set the time, gently push the crown back into the watch.</li>
  <li>Screw the crown back into the watch. Make sure it is securely fastened.</li>
  <li>Write down the time you set the watch to.</li>
  <li>If you have a watch winder, use it to ensure that the watch stays wound and accurate.</li>
