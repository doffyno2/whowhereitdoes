Applying for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) can be a complex process. Depending on the situation, the process can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months. The time it takes to get an EAD after biometrics depends on the type of EAD application you have submitted, the type of biometrics you have provided, and the processing time of the USCIS. 

<h2>What is an EAD?</h2>

An Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is a document issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that allows an individual to legally work in the United States. It is also known as a work permit. It is important to note that an EAD does not provide a permanent residency status; it only allows the holder to work in the U.S. for a period of time. 

<h2>How Long Does it Take to Get an EAD After Biometrics?</h2>

The time it takes to get an EAD after biometrics is dependent upon the type of EAD application you have submitted and the type of biometrics you provided. After submitting the I-765 form, the USCIS will contact you to schedule an appointment for biometrics collection. This process can take several weeks. After the biometric appointment, the USCIS will process your application and determine if you are eligible for an EAD. Depending on the type of application you have submitted and the processing times of the USCIS, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to receive your EAD. 

<h2>Types of EAD Applications</h2>

There are several types of EAD applications that can be filed with the USCIS. These include:

<h3>Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization</h3>

This is the most common type of EAD application. It is used to request a work permit for an individual who is currently in the United States and is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. This form can be filed by individuals who have been granted asylum or refugee status, or those who have an approved nonimmigrant visa such as a student visa or H-1B visa.

<h3>Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status</h3>

This form is used to adjust an individualâ€™s immigration status from nonimmigrant to permanent resident. Individuals who are in the United States and are eligible for a green card can file this form. If approved, the individual will receive an EAD as part of the green card application process.

<h3>Form I-131, Application for Travel Document</h3>

This form is used to request a travel document, such as a re-entry permit or advanced parole. If approved, the individual will receive an EAD as part of the travel document application process. 

<h2>Types of Biometrics</h2>

The USCIS will contact you to collect biometrics for your EAD application. The type of biometrics collected will depend on the type of application you have submitted. For example, if you have filed a Form I-765, the USCIS will collect fingerprints, a photograph, and signature. If you have filed a Form I-485 or Form I-131, the USCIS will collect fingerprints, a photograph, and signature, as well as a digital signature and digital photograph. 

<h2>Processing Times</h2>

The processing time for an EAD application depends on the type of application and the type of biometrics collected. For example, if you have filed a Form I-765 and provided fingerprints, the processing time is typically 60 days from the date the biometrics are collected. If you have filed a Form I-485 or Form I-131 and provided fingerprints and digital biometrics, the processing time is typically 90 days from the date the biometrics are collected. 

<h2>What to Do if You Have Not Received Your EAD</h2>

If you have not received your EAD within the expected processing time, you should contact the USCIS. The USCIS can provide you with updated information about the status of your application and can help you determine what steps you need to take to receive your EAD.
