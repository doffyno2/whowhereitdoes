<h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>

When making boiled hamburger and rice for your pup, you will need the following ingredients: 

<ul>
<li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
<li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Brown the Ground Beef</h3>

The first step to making boiled hamburger and rice for your pup is to brown the ground beef. To do this, add the ground beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use a wooden spoon to break the ground beef into small pieces. Cook the ground beef until it is browned, stirring occasionally.

Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Let the rice simmer until all the water is absorbed, about 10-15 minutes. Once the rice is cooked, remove it from heat and fluff it with a fork. 

<h3>Step 3: Combine the Ingredients</h3>

Next, it is time to combine the ingredients. Start by adding the cooked ground beef and cooked rice to a large bowl. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. Use a spoon or spatula to mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined.
