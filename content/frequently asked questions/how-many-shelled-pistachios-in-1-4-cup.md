Pistachios are a popular and nutritious snack that can be enjoyed in many different ways. From adding them to salads and baked goods to snacking on them straight from the package, pistachios are an excellent source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. But how many shelled pistachios are in a 1/4 cup? 

<h2>A Detailed Look at Pistachios</h2>

Pistachios are a type of nut native to the Middle East and Central Asia. They have been a part of the human diet for thousands of years, with evidence of their consumption going as far back as 7,000 B.C. Pistachios are a part of the cashew family and are related to other tree nuts like almonds and walnuts.

Pistachios have a mild, nutty flavor and a soft, crunchy texture. They are an excellent source of nutrition, with a single serving providing 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 8 grams of healthy fats. They are also rich in vitamins and minerals, including manganese and phosphorus.

<h2>How Many Shelled Pistachios in 1/4 Cup?</h2>

So, how many shelled pistachios are in a 1/4 cup? The answer depends on the size of the pistachios. Generally speaking, you can expect to find approximately 32 shelled pistachios in a 1/4 cup. 

However, the exact number can vary depending on the size of the pistachios. For larger pistachios, you may find fewer than 32 in a 1/4 cup, while for smaller pistachios, you may find more than 32 in a 1/4 cup. 

It is important to note that a 1/4 cup of shelled pistachios is not the same as a 1/4 cup of unshelled pistachios. Unshelled pistachios are much larger than shelled pistachios, so you can expect to find fewer unshelled pistachios in a 1/4 cup. 

<h2>Calculating the Number of Shelled Pistachios in a Serving</h2>

If you need to calculate the exact number of shelled pistachios in a 1/4 cup, you can use the following formula:

Number of Pistachios = (Weight of Pistachios / Weight of 1 Pistachio) x 32

To use this formula, you will need to weigh your pistachios and divide the weight by the weight of a single pistachio. Then multiply this number by 32 to get the number of shelled pistachios in a 1/4 cup. 

<h2>Health Benefits of Pistachios</h2>

In addition to being an excellent source of nutrition, pistachios also offer many health benefits. Studies have shown that eating pistachios can help to reduce cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure. They are also rich in antioxidants and can help to reduce inflammation in the body. 

Additionally, pistachios may help to improve heart health and reduce the risk of certain diseases. They are also a great source of energy and can help to keep you full for longer.

<h2>Tips for Eating Pistachios</h2>

Pistachios can be enjoyed in many different ways. They can be eaten raw, roasted, or salted. They can also be added to salads, baked goods, and other recipes. It is best to buy unshelled pistachios, as they have a longer shelf life and are generally fresher than pre-shelled pistachios. 

When buying pistachios, look for ones that are plump and have a bright green color. Avoid pistachios that are shriveled or discolored, as these may be past their prime.
