Google Maps is an invaluable tool for navigating the world around us, and when it comes to getting from point A to point B, it's one of the most reliable and accurate options available. With Google Maps, we can easily determine the best route to take, how long it will take to get there, and which landmarks, restaurants, and other points of interest are nearby. But it doesn't just stop there; Google Maps also allows users to switch between different modes of transportation, such as walking and driving. 

<h2>What is Google Maps?</h2>

Google Maps is a web-based mapping and navigation service developed by Google. It offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360° panoramic views of streets, real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle, or public transportation. Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application.

You may be able to spot things you wouldn't be able to see if you were in a car. In addition, it's great for those who are trying to get to a destination quickly, as walking will generally be faster and more efficient than driving. And lastly, it's a great way to save money on gas and avoid traffic.
