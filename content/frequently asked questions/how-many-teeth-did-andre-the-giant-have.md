<p>André the Giant was a legendary professional wrestler who was known for his size and strength. He was 7 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 520 pounds at his peak. He was known for his superhuman feats of strength, such as being able to lift an entire ring or break chains with his bare hands. But one thing about André the Giant that is not as well known is how many teeth he had.</p>

<p>André the Giant had a total of 28 teeth in his mouth, which was 8 fewer than the average person. This was due to a condition called hypodontia, which is when someone has fewer than the usual number of teeth. This condition is more common in males, and André the Giant was no exception. He was born with fewer than the usual number of teeth, and he never had any of his adult teeth come in. He did, however, have a full set of dentures that he wore when he was in the ring.</p>

<p>André the Giant's smaller-than-average number of teeth was a source of embarrassment for him. He was often teased and ridiculed by his peers and opponents in the wrestling ring. He wanted to have a full set of teeth, but it was not possible due to the hypodontia. He would often hide his mouth behind his hands or a towel when he was in the ring.</p>

<p>André the Giant's smaller-than-average number of teeth did not affect his wrestling performance in any way. In fact, it may have even helped him. His smaller number of teeth meant he had less weight to carry around in his mouth, which could have helped him be more agile and quick in the ring. It also meant he had less of a chance to be injured in the ring due to a misaligned bite.</p>

<p>André the Giant was an amazing athlete and performer, and his smaller-than-average number of teeth did not stop him from achieving greatness. He was a larger-than-life figure in the world of professional wrestling, and his legacy will live on forever. He will be remembered as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.</p>
