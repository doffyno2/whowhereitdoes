<p>When it comes to crafting the perfect set of armour and tools, there's no better material than diamond. Diamond is not only the strongest material in Minecraft, but it also has the highest durability and enchantability. This makes it the perfect material for any set of armour or tools. But how much diamond do you need to make a full set?</p>

<p>In order to craft a full set of diamond armour and tools, you will need a total of 24 diamonds. This is because each piece of diamond armour requires five diamonds, and each diamond tool requires one diamond. This means you will need a total of five pieces of armour and four tools for a full set. It may seem like a lot of diamonds, but it is worth it for the strength and durability you get in return.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're looking to save a few diamonds here and there, you can always opt for a mix of diamond and other materials. For instance, you can use iron or gold for the helmet, chestplate, and leggings, and then use diamond for the boots and tools. This will save you a few diamonds while still giving you the strength and durability of diamond tools and armour.</p>

<p>However, if you are looking to create the strongest armor and tools possible, then you should go all out and use diamond for everything. This will ensure that your armour and tools are the strongest and most durable in the game.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Smelt the armour and tools. Place the armour and tools in the furnace and smelt them. This will turn them into diamond armour and tools, making them much stronger and durable.</li>
