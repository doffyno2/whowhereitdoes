<p>When trying to figure out how many combinations with four digits, it is important to understand the concept of permutation and combination. A permutation is an arrangement of objects, without repetition, and order being important. A combination is an arrangement of objects, without repetition, and order not being important. </p>

<p>The number of permutations of four digits is 10,000. This is because the first digit can be any of the 10 digits (0-9), and each remaining digit can be any of the remaining nine digits. Each successive digit has one fewer choice than the one before it, so the total number of permutations is 10x9x8x7, which equals 10,000.</p>

<p>The number of combinations of four digits is much smaller. This is because the order of the digits does not matter. For example, the combination 1234 is the same as the combination 3241. The number of combinations of four digits is 1,024. This is because the first digit can be any of the 10 digits (0-9) and each remaining digit can be any of the remaining nine digits. Each successive digit has one fewer choice than the one before it, so the total number of combinations is 10x9x8x7 divided by 4x3x2x1, which equals 1,024.</p>

<h2>Examples of Combinations with 4 Digits</h2>

<p>There are many examples of combinations with four digits. Here are a few examples:

</ul>

<p>These are just some examples of combinations with four digits. There are many more.</p>

<h2>Uses of Combinations with 4 Digits</h2>

<p>Combinations with four digits are used in many different situations. For example, they are used in passwords and PIN numbers. They can also be used to generate random numbers for lottery games, or for other random number generation applications. Combinations with four digits can also be used to generate unique product codes for retail products.</p>

<p>Combinations with four digits are also used in computer science and cryptography. They can be used to encrypt data, generate keys, and more. Combinations with four digits can also be used to create unique identifiers for items in databases, or to generate unique serial numbers.</p>
