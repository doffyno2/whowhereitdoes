<p>The question of how tall 166cm is in feet can be easily answered by converting cm to feet. In order to convert centimetres to feet, a person needs to divide cm by 30.48. This will result in feet and inches, which can be used to answer the question. For example, 166 cm is equal to 5 feet 5.35 inches.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the conversion from centimetres to feet is not a precise science, as the precise measurement of a foot can vary slightly. The conversion rate used for the calculation of 166 cm to feet was developed by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. This rate is the most widely accepted conversion rate and is used by most countries in the world.</p>

<p>When converting from centimetres to feet, it is important to remember that the number of centimetres must be converted to the number of inches. This is done by multiplying the number of centimetres by 0.393701. This number is then added to the number of feet in order to get the total number of inches. In the example of 166 cm, this would result in 5.35 inches.</p>

<p>When determining how tall 166 cm is in feet, it is important to remember that the measurement is based on the metric system. This system of measurements is based on the power of ten, which is why it is important to remember that the conversion from centimetres to feet is not an exact science. It is important to remember that the number of feet and inches may vary slightly, depending on the measurement.</p>

<h2>How to Convert 166cm to Feet</h2>

<p>The best way to convert 166cm to feet is by using a simple calculation. The calculation is as follows: 166 cm divided by 30.48 equals 5 feet 5.35 inches. This simple calculation can be used to convert any number of cm to feet, as long as the conversion rate of 30.48 is used.</p>
