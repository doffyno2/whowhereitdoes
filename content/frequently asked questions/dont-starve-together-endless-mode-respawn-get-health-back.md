Don't Starve Together is a popular co-op survival game from Klei Entertainment. Players must work together to survive in a hostile environment filled with monsters and other dangers. In the game, players must scavenge for resources, craft items, build shelters, and fend off enemies. One of the most challenging aspects of the game is the Endless Mode, where players must survive as long as possible without any respawns.

In Don't Starve Together, the Endless Mode is a special type of game mode that has no respawns. This means that once a player dies, they are out of the game and cannot come back.

In Don't Starve Together, players can get their health back in the Endless Mode by using certain items and strategies. The first way to get your health back is by eating food.
