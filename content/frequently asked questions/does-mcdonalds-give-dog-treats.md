<h2>A Brief History of McDonald’s and Pets</h2>

McDonald’s has had an interesting relationship with pets over the years. In the 1950s, customers were encouraged to bring their pets into restaurants, and some locations even had pet-centric menus. However, due to health and safety concerns, this practice eventually ended. 

<h2>Do They Offer Dog Treats?</h2>
