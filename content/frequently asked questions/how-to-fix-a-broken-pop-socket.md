How to Fix a Broken Pop Socket



Pop sockets are a great way to keep your phone secure and comfortable in your hand. They come in a variety of styles and colors, and can be easily attached to your phone with adhesive backing. However, pop sockets can be easily broken, leaving you with a useless piece of plastic stuck to your phone. In this article, we'll explain how to fix a broken pop socket so that you can get the most out of your accessory.



Pop sockets are small, round discs made of plastic or rubber that attach to the back of your phone. They are designed to provide you with a secure grip when holding your phone, as well as a place to rest your fingers while texting. Pop sockets often come with adhesive backing, which allows them to stick to the back of your phone.



If your pop socket is broken, you'll need to fix it in order to continue using it. Here are some tips for repairing your broken pop socket:

<h2>1. Clean the Surface</h2>

The first step in repairing a broken pop socket is to clean the surface of the phone. You'll want to make sure that there is no debris on the surface, as this could prevent the adhesive from sticking properly. Use a damp cloth to gently wipe away any dirt or debris from the surface.

<h2>2. Remove the Old Pop Socket</h2>

Once the surface is clean, you'll need to remove the old pop socket. If it is still attached, use a pair of tweezers or a small screwdriver to pry it off the phone. If there is any adhesive residue left behind, use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove it.

<h2>3. Attach the New Pop Socket</h2>

Now that the surface is clean and the old pop socket is removed, it's time to attach the new one. Peel off the adhesive backing from the new pop socket and attach it to the back of the phone. Make sure that it is securely attached, as it will need to be strong enough to hold up to daily wear and tear.

<h2>4. Test the New Pop Socket</h2>

Once the new pop socket is attached, it's time to test it out. Put your phone in your hand and see if the pop socket is securely attached. If it is, you should be able to grip your phone comfortably without fear of it slipping out of your hand.
