<p>If you're an avid fan of the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you may have noticed that weapons and shields can break after prolonged use. While this is a natural part of the game, it can be frustrating when your favorite weapon shatters just as you're about to defeat a powerful enemy. Fortunately, there is a way to repair broken weapons in Breath of the Wild, and in this article, we'll explain how to do it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Weapons to Break in Breath of the Wild?</h2>

<p>In Breath of the Wild, most weapons and shields have a durability meter which is visible when you equip the items. As you use the weapon or shield, the durability meter will steadily decrease. If the meter reaches zero, the weapon or shield will break and be unusable until it is repaired. Certain weapons and shields are more durable than others, and some are even unbreakable.</p>
