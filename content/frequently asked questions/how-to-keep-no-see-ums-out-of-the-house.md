No see ums, or biting midges, are tiny, blood-sucking insects that can cause frustration and irritation for homeowners. Although no see ums are small, they can be a major nuisance. These insects enter homes through open windows and doors, and they can bite humans and other animals. If you're looking for ways to keep no see ums out of your home, there are a few simple steps you can take to make your home less attractive to these pesky bugs.

<h2>What Are No See Ums?</h2>

No see ums are small, gnat-like insects that measure between 1 and 4 millimeters in length. They are dark gray or black in color and have a wingspan of about 1 millimeter. They are also known as biting midges because of their tendency to bite humans and other animals. No see ums feed on blood and can cause irritation and discomfort when they bite.

<h2>Where Do No See Ums Live?</h2>

No see ums are most commonly found in wet, humid areas near water sources, such as swamps, marshes, and ponds. They also thrive in areas with high concentrations of plant life, such as gardens and wooded areas. No see ums are most active at dawn and dusk, when they emerge to feed on blood.

<h2>How to Keep No See Ums Out of the House</h2>

There are several steps you can take to prevent no see ums from entering your home. These include:

<h3>1. Keep Doors and Windows Closed</h3>

No see ums can enter your home through open windows and doors. To prevent no see ums from entering your home, make sure that all windows and doors are closed when not in use. It's also a good idea to check your windows and doors for any gaps or cracks that may allow these bugs to enter.

<h3>2. Install Mesh Screens</h3>

Mesh screens can be installed on windows and doors to prevent no see ums from entering your home. The mesh should have holes that are no larger than 1 millimeter in size, as no see ums can pass through larger openings. Make sure to check the mesh screens regularly for any holes or tears that may allow these bugs to enter.

<h3>3. Remove Standing Water</h3>

No see ums are attracted to standing water, so it's important to remove any sources of standing water near your home. This includes water that collects in birdbaths, gutters, and buckets. If you have a swimming pool, make sure to keep it clean and free of debris.

<h3>4. Use Insect Repellent</h3>

Using insect repellent can help keep no see ums away from your home and yard. Insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin are effective at keeping no see ums away. These repellents should be applied to clothing and exposed skin to keep no see ums away.

<h3>5. Use Citronella Candles</h3>

Citronella candles emit a strong scent that can help keep no see ums away. These candles should be placed around your yard and near doors and windows. Make sure to keep the candles away from flammable materials, and replace them when the scent begins to fade.
