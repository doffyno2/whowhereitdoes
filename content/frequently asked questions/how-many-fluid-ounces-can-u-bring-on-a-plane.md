Traveling by plane can be stressful, so it's important to know the regulations before you go. One of the most common questions people have is, how many fluid ounces can you bring on a plane? The short answer is that the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) allows you to bring liquids, gels, aerosols, creams and pastes in containers that are 3.4 ounces (or 100 milliliters) or smaller. These containers must be placed in a clear, quart-sized plastic bag.

<h2>What Counts as a Liquid?</h2>

The TSA considers any substance that is liquid or can become a liquid at room temperature to be a liquid. This includes:

<ul>
  <li>Water and other beverages, including juice, soda, and alcohol</li>
  <li>Soups and sauces</li>
  <li>Creams, lotions, and oils, including skin care and hair care products</li>
  <li>Perfumes and colognes</li>
  <li>Gels, including toothpaste</li>
  <li>Aerosols, including hairspray and deodorant</li>
  <li>Lip balm and lipstick</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exceptions to the 3.4 Ounce Rule</h2>

The TSA does make some exceptions to the 3.4 ounce rule for certain items. These items include:

<ul>
  <li>Baby formula, breast milk, and juice for infants and toddlers. These items may be carried in larger containers, but must be declared for inspection at the security checkpoint.</li>
  <li>Prescription medications for personal use, including liquid medications. If a medication is in a container larger than 3.4 ounces, you must declare it to the TSA and the container will be inspected. You should also pack the medication in its original, labeled container.</li>
  <li>Non-prescription liquid or gel medications, such as cough syrup or eye drops, must be in containers that are 3.4 ounces or smaller. If the medication is in a container larger than 3.4 ounces, it must be declared to the TSA and the container will be inspected.</li>
  <li>Liquids or gels purchased in duty-free shops must be placed in a tamper-evident bag and declared for inspection. These items may be larger than 3.4 ounces.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for Packing Liquids and Gels</h2>

When packing liquids and gels for a plane trip, here are some tips to keep in mind:

<ul>
  <li>Pack all of your liquids and gels in a clear, quart-sized plastic bag. This bag must be taken out of your carry-on bag and placed into a separate bin for inspection at the security checkpoint.</li>
  <li>If you are traveling with a baby, you may bring larger quantities of baby formula, breast milk, and juice, but these items must be declared at the security checkpoint.</li>
  <li>Creams and oils may be larger than 3.4 ounces, but may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint. It is best to pack these items in your checked baggage.</li>
  <li>Any liquid or gel purchased in a duty-free shop must be in a tamper-evident bag and declared for inspection.</li>
  <li>If you are carrying a prescription medication, it must be in its original container. You must also declare the medication at the security checkpoint.</li>
  <li>If you are carrying any other liquids or gels, they must be in containers that are 3.4 ounces or smaller.</li>
</ul>
