<p>If you’ve ever tried to hang pictures or wall decorations with Command strips, you know that they’re great for keeping your walls clean and damage-free. But sometimes when you take down the decorations, you’re left with a sticky residue on the wall that’s hard to remove. Fortunately, there are a few easy steps that you can take to get rid of the Command strip residue without damaging your walls.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Use a Hair Dryer</h2>
<p>The first step to removing Command strip residue is to use a hairdryer. Heat up the residue until it’s warm and then use a cloth to wipe it away. Be sure to use a hairdryer on the lowest heat setting so that you don’t damage the wall or paint. If the residue still won’t come off, you can try a heat gun or a hot iron.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Try Rubbing Alcohol</h2>
<p>If the heat method doesn’t work, you can try using rubbing alcohol. Soak a cloth in rubbing alcohol and then rub it onto the residue. Be sure to use a soft cloth so that you don’t damage the wall or paint. Rub the cloth in a circular motion to help loosen the residue. Once you’ve loosened the residue, you can use a damp cloth to wipe it away.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use Soap and Water</h2>
<p>If the rubbing alcohol doesn’t work, you can try using a mild soap and water solution. Mix a small amount of soap in some warm water, and then use a cloth to apply the mixture to the residue. The soap and water should help to loosen the residue and make it easier to remove. Once the residue has been loosened, use a damp cloth to wipe it away.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use Goo Gone</h2>
<p>If the soap and water method doesn’t work, you can try using Goo Gone. This is a special cleaner that is designed to remove sticky residue from walls. Simply apply a small amount of the Goo Gone to a cloth and then rub it onto the residue. Be sure to use a soft cloth so that you don’t damage the wall or paint. Once the residue has been removed, use a damp cloth to wipe away the Goo Gone.</p>
