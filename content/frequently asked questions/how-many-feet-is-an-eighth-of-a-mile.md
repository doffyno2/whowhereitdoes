<p>It is common knowledge that one mile is equal to 5,280 feet. But what about fractional parts of a mile? How many feet are in an eighth of a mile? The answer to this question is 660 feet. This is because 1/8 of 5,280 is 660.</p>

<p>An eighth of a mile is a very common measurement in the United States, especially in terms of running and walking distances. It is also used for other types of measurements, such as for measuring the distance between two points in a city. As a result, it is important to know how many feet are in an eighth of a mile.</p>

<p>In addition to knowing how many feet are in an eighth of a mile, it is also important to understand the concept of fractions and how they relate to measuring distance. For example, a half of a mile is equal to 2,640 feet. This is because 1/2 of 5,280 is 2,640. Similarly, a quarter of a mile is equal to 1,320 feet. This is because 1/4 of 5,280 is 1,320.</p>

<p>It is also important to understand the concept of conversions when it comes to measuring distance. For example, one mile is equal to 8 furlongs. A furlong is equal to 220 yards, and a yard is equal to 3 feet. This means that one mile is equal to 5,280 feet. Therefore, an eighth of a mile is equal to 660 feet.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between an Eighth of a Mile and a Quarter Mile?</h2>

<p>The difference between an eighth of a mile and a quarter mile is the distance traveled. An eighth of a mile is equal to 660 feet, while a quarter mile is equal to 1,320 feet. This means that a quarter mile is twice as long as an eighth of a mile.</p>

<p>The difference between these two measurements is also visible in terms of running or walking. For example, a runner or walker would need to cover twice the amount of distance to run a quarter mile as they would to run an eighth of a mile.</p>

<h2>How Far is an Eighth of a Mile When Running?</h2>
