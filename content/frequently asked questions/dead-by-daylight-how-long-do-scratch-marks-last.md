Dead by Daylight is a popular horror game on PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It is a 4v1 asymmetrical game where four survivors try to escape from a killer. The game features several different types of killers and survivors, as well as a variety of items, perks and add-ons to customize the game to your liking. One of the most important components of the game is the scratch marks left by the killers. In this article, we will discuss how long scratch marks last in Dead by Daylight and how to use them to your advantage.

<h2>What are Scratch Marks?</h2>

Scratch marks are lines that appear on the ground as a killer moves around the map. They are created by the killer's claws and are meant to give survivors an idea of where the killer has gone. They are visible for a limited amount of time, and can be used to track the killer's movements and anticipate where they will go next.

<h2>How Long Do Scratch Marks Last?</h2>

Scratch marks last for a limited amount of time in Dead by Daylight. They are visible for approximately 15 seconds before they fade away, so survivors must act quickly if they want to take advantage of them. The scratch marks also show up differently depending on the type of killer. For example, the Legion killer has longer scratch marks that are easier to spot, while the Wraith killer has shorter, less distinct marks.

<h2>How to Use Scratch Marks to Your Advantage</h2>

Scratch marks can be used to your advantage in Dead by Daylight. Knowing where the killer has been can give you an edge when navigating the map, as it will allow you to avoid areas that the killer has already patrolled. It can also help you anticipate where the killer might go next, so you can set up ambushes or prepare to escape. Knowing when the scratch marks will disappear is also important, as it allows you to time your movements to avoid detection.

<h2>Tips for Using Scratch Marks</h2>

There are several tips that can help you make the most of scratch marks in Dead by Daylight. When you spot a scratch mark, move quickly to take advantage of it. If you wait too long, the scratch mark will disappear and you will have to start searching again.

Finally, always keep an eye out for the killer, as they can still spot you even if you are using the scratch marks to your advantage.
