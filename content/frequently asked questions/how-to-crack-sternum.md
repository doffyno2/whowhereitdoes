Cracking a sternum can be a daunting task for those who have never done it before. It requires a lot of skill and precision, and can be a tricky maneuver for even experienced medical professionals. In this guide, we'll be taking a look at the steps involved in cracking a sternum, as well as the potential risks and benefits of doing so. 

<h2>What is a Sternum?</h2>

The sternum, or breastbone, is a flat bone located in the center of the chest. It connects the ribs to the vertebral column and helps protect the heart and lungs. It is an important part of the bodyâ€™s skeletal structure and is essential for maintaining a proper posture. 

<h2>Why Crack a Sternum?</h2>

Cracking a sternum can be a useful medical procedure in certain cases. It is typically done when a doctor needs to gain access to the chest cavity in order to perform a procedure, such as a heart bypass or a lung transplant. It can also be done to relieve pressure on the chest, such as in the case of a collapsed lung. 

<h2>How to Crack a Sternum</h2>

Cracking a sternum is a delicate procedure that requires precision and skill. The process usually involves an anesthesiologist and a surgeon. Here are the steps involved in cracking a sternum: 

<h3>Step 1: Administer Anesthesia</h3>

The first step in cracking a sternum is to administer anesthesia. This is done to ensure that the patient does not feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will typically use a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, to numb the area. 

<h3>Step 2: Make an Incision</h3>

Once the patient is numb, the surgeon will make an incision in the chest. The incision will be made along the sternum and will go through the skin and muscle layers. 

<h3>Step 3: Insert a Retractor</h3>

The surgeon will then insert a retractor into the incision. The retractor is a tool that helps to hold the skin and muscle layers apart. This will allow the surgeon to have better access to the sternum. 

<h3>Step 4: Crack the Sternum</h3>

The surgeon will then use a tool to crack the sternum. This tool is usually a pair of forceps with sharp points. The forceps are placed on either side of the sternum and then used to apply pressure in order to crack the bone. 

<h3>Step 5: Perform the Procedure</h3>

Once the sternum is cracked, the surgeon will be able to perform the necessary procedure. This could be a heart bypass, a lung transplant, or any other procedure that requires access to the chest cavity. 

<h3>Step 6: Close the Incision</h3>

Once the procedure is complete, the surgeon will close the incision. This is usually done with a few stitches or staples. 

<h2>Risks and Benefits of Cracking a Sternum</h2>

Cracking a sternum is a major medical procedure and there are risks and benefits associated with it. The potential risks include infection, bleeding, and nerve damage. On the other hand, the potential benefits of cracking a sternum include improved access to the chest cavity, which can allow for better and more precise medical procedures.
