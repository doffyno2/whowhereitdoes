<p>Dungeons and Dragons 5e (DnD 5e) is a popular tabletop role-playing game that has been around for decades. Players take on the role of adventurers in a fantasy world, and together they explore its many secrets and dangers. One important part of any adventure is the journey, and understanding how far characters can travel in a day is critical for planning. This article will explain how far characters can travel in a day in DnD 5e.</p>

<h2>What Is a Travel Pace in DnD 5e?</h2>

<p>The travel pace of a character in DnD 5e is the speed at which they move while travelling. There are three travel paces in DnD 5e: slow, regular, and fast. The slow pace is the slowest, the regular pace is the middle ground, and the fast pace is the fastest. The pace of travel affects how far a character can travel in a given period of time.</p>

<h2>How Far Can Characters Travel in a Day?</h2>

<p>The amount of distance a character can travel in a day depends on the pace of travel. At the slow pace, a character can travel up to 6 miles in a day. At the regular pace, a character can travel up to 12 miles in a day. At the fast pace, a character can travel up to 18 miles in a day. Of course, these distances assume that the character does not stop for anything during their journey.</p>

<h2>What Factors Affect Travel Pace?</h2>

<p>The pace of travel can be affected by a number of factors. For instance, if a character is carrying a heavy load, they may move more slowly. Similarly, if the terrain is difficult or dangerous, the character may need to slow down. Weather conditions can also affect the pace of travel, as characters may need to move more slowly in inclement weather. Finally, the speed of the character's mount or vehicle can affect the pace of travel.</p>

<h2>What Is a Forced March?</h2>

<p>A forced march is a type of travel that allows characters to travel farther than usual in a given period of time. During a forced march, characters can travel up to 24 miles in a day. However, this type of travel is incredibly strenuous and dangerous, and characters must make Constitution saving throws at the end of the day or suffer exhaustion. Because of this, forced marches should only be used in emergencies.</p>

<h2>Can Characters Travel at Night?</h2>

<p>Yes, characters can travel at night, but it is usually more dangerous than travelling during the day. Travel at night is usually slower than during the day, as characters can't see as far ahead and may need to stop more often. Additionally, some creatures only come out at night, and this can make travelling at night more dangerous than during the day.</p>

<h2>How Does Rest Affect Travel?</h2>

<p>Rest is an important part of any journey, as it allows characters to regain their strength and energy. A character can rest for up to 8 hours in a day, and this time does not count towards the time they spend travelling. However, if a character rests for more than 8 hours in a day, this time will count towards their travel time and reduce the amount of distance they can travel in that day.</p>
