<p>Popcorn is a tasty snack that is low in calories and fat, and high in fiber. It's a great way to satisfy hunger without packing on the pounds. But how many calories are in a bag of microwave popcorn? The answer depends on the type of popcorn, the amount of butter, and other ingredients used.</p>

<p>Unpopped popcorn kernels contain about 4 calories per kernel. This means that a single serving of unpopped popcorn – roughly one-third of a cup – contains about 40 calories. Once popcorn is popped, the calorie count goes up. One cup of air-popped popcorn contains about 31 calories, while one cup of oil-popped popcorn contains about 55 calories.</p>

<p>When it comes to microwave popcorn, the calorie count varies greatly depending on the ingredients and the brand. For instance, a 3.5-ounce bag of Orville Redenbacher's plain popcorn contains about 150 calories, while a 3.5-ounce bag of Orville Redenbacher's butter popcorn contains about 220 calories. A 3.5-ounce bag of Act II butter popcorn contains about 170 calories.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that microwave popcorn is often coated with butter, oil, and other flavorings that can add to the calorie count. Some brands of microwave popcorn also contain sugar and other sweeteners, which can add even more calories. So if you're counting calories, it's important to read the nutrition facts label on the package to get an accurate calorie count.</p>

<h2>Calories in Other Types of Popcorn</h2>

<p>Popcorn is a versatile snack that can be made in a variety of ways. Depending on the recipe, popcorn can have more or fewer calories. For example, popcorn that is made with butter or oil will have more calories than popcorn that is made with just air. And popcorn that is coated with sugar or other sweeteners will have even more calories.</p>

<p>Popcorn that is made with just air can have as few as 31 calories per cup. Popcorn that is made with butter, oil, or other fats can have up to 55 calories per cup. And popcorn that is coated with sugar or other sweeteners can have up to 100 calories per cup.</p>

<h2>Calories in Popcorn Toppings</h2>

<p>Popcorn can be topped with a variety of ingredients, including butter, oil, cheese, and seasonings. Each topping adds a different number of calories to the popcorn. For example, one tablespoon of butter adds about 100 calories, while one tablespoon of oil adds about 120 calories. One tablespoon of cheese adds about 50 calories, and one teaspoon of sugar adds about 16 calories.</p>

<p>When it comes to seasonings, each type has a different calorie count. For example, one teaspoon of garlic powder adds about 6 calories, while one teaspoon of chili powder adds about 5 calories. So if you're counting calories, it's important to pay attention to the toppings you're adding to your popcorn.</p>

<h2>Calories in Popcorn Balls</h2>

<p>Popcorn balls are a popular treat, especially during the holidays. But they can be quite high in calories. A single popcorn ball can contain anywhere from 100 to 300 calories, depending on the ingredients used. Popcorn balls that are made with butter or oil will have more calories than popcorn balls that are made with just air.</p>

<p>Popcorn balls can also be topped with candy, icing, and other sweeteners, which can add even more calories. So if you're counting calories, it's important to pay attention to the ingredients used in the recipe and the toppings added to the popcorn balls.</p>
