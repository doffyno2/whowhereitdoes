<p>Facebook is a powerful social media platform, and it allows you to connect with friends, family, and acquaintances in a variety of ways. Not only can you view their profiles and comment on their posts, but you can also follow them and see the updates they post on their timeline. But how do you see who you're following on Facebook?</p>

<p>In this article, we'll explain how to view your list of followers on Facebook, and we'll also discuss the difference between following and friending someone on the platform. Finally, we'll provide some tips for managing your Facebook followers.</p>

<h2>How to View Your Followers on Facebook</h2>

<p>Viewing your list of followers on Facebook is easy. All you have to do is log in to your account and click on your profile picture in the top-right corner. From there, select the "Following" option from the drop-down menu. This will take you to a page that displays the list of people you are currently following.</p>

<p>On this page, you can also view the list of people who are following you. To do this, look for the "Followers" option on the left-hand side of the page. Clicking on this will take you to a page that displays the list of people who are following you.</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Following and Friending Someone on Facebook</h2>

<p>It's important to understand the difference between following and friending someone on Facebook. When you follow someone, you will see all of their public posts in your news feed. However, when you friend someone, you will be able to see all of their posts, regardless of their privacy settings.</p>

<p>It's also important to remember that when you follow someone, they will not receive a notification. However, when you friend someone, they will receive a notification that you have sent them a friend request.</p>

<h2>Managing Your Facebook Followers</h2>

<p>Managing your list of followers on Facebook can be a bit tricky. If you don't want someone to be able to view your posts, it's best to unfollow them instead of unfriending them. This way, they won't receive a notification that you have unfriended them, but they won't be able to view your posts.</p>

<p>If you want to block someone from viewing your posts, you can do so by selecting the "Block" option from the drop-down menu next to their name on the list of followers. This will prevent them from being able to view your posts, and it will also prevent them from sending you messages or friend requests.</p>
