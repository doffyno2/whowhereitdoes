# How Many Miles Is 400 km?

400 kilometers, or km, is equal to 248.551 miles. It is a common question for people trying to convert metric measurements to imperial measurements, or vice versa. Knowing how to convert between the two systems can be useful for traveling and for other calculations. This article will explain the conversion between kilometers and miles, provide some helpful examples, and discuss why it is important to know how to make the conversion. 

## What Is a Kilometer?

A kilometer is a unit of measurement for length in the metric system. It is equal to 1,000 meters or 0.6214 miles. It is commonly used to measure distances between two points, such as the distance between two cities or the distance traveled by a vehicle. 

## What Is a Mile?

A mile is a unit of measurement for length in the imperial system. It is equal to 5,280 feet or 1.609 kilometers. It is commonly used to measure distances between two points, such as the distance between two cities or the distance traveled by a vehicle. 

## How to Convert Kilometers to Miles

To convert kilometers to miles, use the following formula: 

Miles = Kilometers x 0.6214

For example, if you need to convert 400 kilometers to miles, you would use the following calculation: 

Miles = 400 x 0.6214 = 248.551

Therefore, 400 kilometers is equal to 248.551 miles. 

## How to Convert Miles to Kilometers

To convert miles to kilometers, use the following formula: 

Kilometers = Miles x 1.609

For example, if you need to convert 400 miles to kilometers, you would use the following calculation: 

Kilometers = 400 x 1.609 = 643.6

Therefore, 400 miles is equal to 643.6 kilometers. 

## Why Is It Important to Know How to Convert Between Kilometers and Miles?

Knowing how to convert between kilometers and miles is important for a variety of reasons. If you are traveling to another country, you may need to be able to convert between the two systems of measurement. Additionally, it can be useful for calculations involving distances or speeds. For example, if you know the speed of a vehicle in kilometers per hour, you may need to convert it to miles per hour in order to understand the speed in the imperial system.
