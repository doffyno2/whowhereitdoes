<p>Argon is an element which is composed of three atoms. It is in the group 18 of the periodic table, which is also known as the noble gases group. Argon is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas which is the third most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It is a non-reactive element which is used in a variety of industrial processes.</p>

<p>Electrons are negatively charged particles which are found in atoms. The number of electrons which are found in an atom of any particular element is determined by the number of protons which are present in the atom. Since argon is an element, it will contain a certain number of electrons which are determined by the number of protons in the atom.</p>

<p>The number of protons in an atom of argon is 18. Therefore, the number of electrons in an atom of argon is also 18. This is because the number of protons and electrons in an atom are always equal. Each electron carries a single negative charge, which means that an atom of argon will contain 18 negative charges.</p>

<h2>Properties of Electrons in Argon</h2>

<p>The electrons in an atom of argon are arranged in different energy levels known as shells. The first shell, or the K shell, can contain up to two electrons. The second shell, or the L shell, can contain up to eight electrons. The third shell, or the M shell, can contain up to eight electrons. The fourth shell, or the N shell, can contain up to two electrons.</p>

<p>The electrons in the various shells of argon are arranged in a specific manner. This arrangement is known as the electron configuration. The electron configuration of argon is 1s2 2s2 2p6. This means that the first shell is filled with two electrons, the second shell is filled with eight electrons, and the third shell is filled with eight electrons. The fourth shell is empty.</p>

<p>The electrons in an atom of argon are arranged in such a way that they form a stable arrangement. This stable arrangement is known as the octet rule. The octet rule states that atoms must have eight electrons in their outermost shell in order to achieve a stable arrangement. Since an atom of argon contains 18 electrons, it follows the octet rule and is considered to be a stable atom.</p>

<h2>Uses of Argon</h2>

<p>Argon is used in a variety of industries due to its non-reactive properties. It is often used as an inert gas in the production of light bulbs and fluorescent lights. Argon is also used in the production of welding and lasers. It is also used as a cooling gas in nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>Argon is also used in the production of metals and alloys. It is often used as an inert gas in the production of steel. It is also used as a shielding gas in the arc welding process. Argon can also be used as a carrier gas in gas chromatography.</p>

<p>Argon is also used in the medical field. It is used in the production of medical devices such as catheters and syringes. It is also used in the cryogenics industry, where it is used to cool and preserve biological samples. Argon is also used in medical imaging devices such as MRI machines.</p>
