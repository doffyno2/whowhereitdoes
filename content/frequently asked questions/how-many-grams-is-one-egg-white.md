When it comes to baking and cooking, one of the most common measurements used is the weight of egg whites. Knowing how many grams make up one egg white can save you time and help make sure your recipes come out just right. In this article, we'll take a look at how many grams is one egg white and some tips on measuring it accurately.

<h2>What is an Egg White?</h2>

An egg white is the clear liquid that surrounds the yolk of a chicken egg. Egg whites are a popular ingredient in baking and cooking, as it can help give a light and airy texture to many dishes. It is also a source of protein, making it a great addition to a healthy diet.

<h2>How Many Grams is One Egg White?</h2>

The answer to the question of how many grams is one egg white varies from egg to egg. Generally speaking, one large egg white will have approximately 17 grams. However, the size of the egg and its age will affect the weight of the egg white. An egg white from a very small egg may only weigh around 10 grams, while an egg white from a jumbo egg may weigh as much as 20 grams.

<h2>Measuring an Egg White</h2>

If you’re measuring egg whites for a recipe, it is important to measure accurately. The best way to do this is to use a kitchen scale. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, the next best method is to crack the egg and separate the white from the yolk. Carefully measure out the egg white with a measuring cup so that you know exactly how much you’re adding to the recipe.

<h2>Tips for Measuring Egg Whites</h2>

When measuring egg whites, it is important to remember that you should measure before you whip them. Whipping egg whites increases the volume, so if you’re measuring them after they’ve been whipped, the amount you get may be different than what the recipe calls for. It is also important to note that if you’re using a recipe that calls for a specific number of ounces, you should convert it to grams before measuring.

<h2>Substituting Egg Whites</h2>

If you don’t have egg whites on hand or don’t want to use them, there are some other ingredients you can use as a substitute. One option is to mix together 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to create a slurry. This can be used as a substitute for one egg white. Another option is to use 1 tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt as a substitute for one egg white.
