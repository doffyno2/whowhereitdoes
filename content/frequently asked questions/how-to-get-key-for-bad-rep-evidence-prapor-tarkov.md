<p>Escape from Tarkov is an intense game that requires players to survive in the Russian city of Tarkov. One of the main objectives of the game is to complete quests, which can grant players access to new weapons, armor, and items. One such quest is the “Bad Rep Evidence” quest, which requires players to obtain a key for Prapor’s office. There are several steps to obtaining this key, and this article will outline how players can complete the quest.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Find the Key</h2>

<p>The first step to obtaining the key for Prapor's office is to locate it. The key can be found in several different locations, including the Customs military checkpoint, the Gas Station, or the Interchange. Once the key has been located, it must be acquired. Depending on the location of the key, this could require the player to fight off enemies or use stealth to avoid detection.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Unlock the Door</h2>

<p>Once the key has been acquired, the next step is to unlock the door to Prapor’s office. This can be accomplished by using the key on the door. Once the door has been unlocked, the player can then enter the office and search for the evidence needed to complete the quest.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Collect the Evidence</h2>

<p>The evidence needed to complete the quest can be found inside Prapor’s office. The evidence can be found in several different locations, including on the desk, in the filing cabinets, or in the safe. Once the evidence has been collected, the player can then return to the quest giver and turn in the evidence.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Turn in the Evidence</h2>

<p>The final step in completing the “Bad Rep Evidence” quest is to turn in the evidence to the quest giver. This can be done by speaking to the quest giver and informing them of the evidence that has been collected. Once the evidence has been turned in, the quest will be complete and the player will be rewarded.</p>
