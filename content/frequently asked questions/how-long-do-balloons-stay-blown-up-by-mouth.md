<p>Blowing up balloons with your mouth is a classic party trick, and a great way to entertain kids and guests at any type of event. But how long can you keep a balloon inflated just with your breath?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of balloon you are using and the amount of air you can put in it. Latex balloons are more elastic than plastic and will hold air for a longer time. Plastic balloons will deflate faster, so you have to be careful when blowing them up.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting How Long Balloons Stay Blown Up</h2>

<p>The amount of air you put in the balloon is the most important factor in determining how long it will stay inflated. If you want a balloon to last longer, you must blow it up slowly and evenly, until it's almost full. Don't overfill it, or it will burst.</p>

<p>The type of balloon will also affect how long it will last. Latex balloons are more elastic than plastic, so they will stay inflated for longer. Latex balloons also have a smaller surface area, which helps keep the air in. Plastic balloons, on the other hand, are not as elastic, so they will deflate faster.</p>

<p>The temperature of the air will also affect how long a balloon will stay inflated. Hot air expands and takes up more space, so it will cause the balloon to deflate faster. Cold air, on the other hand, will not take up as much space, so it will help keep the balloon inflated for longer.</p>

<h2>How Long Do Balloons Stay Blown Up By Mouth?</h2>

<p>In general, balloons will stay inflated for between 5 and 10 minutes if they are blown up by mouth. This can vary depending on the size of the balloon, the amount of air you put in it, the type of balloon and the temperature of the air. If you want the balloon to last longer, you must blow it up slowly and evenly, until it's almost full.</p>

<h2>Tips For Keeping Balloons Blown Up Longer</h2>

<p>To keep a balloon blown up for longer, you need to use a good quality balloon and blow it up slowly and evenly. Try to keep the balloon away from any sources of heat, as this can cause it to expand and deflate faster. You can also fill the balloon with more air, but be careful not to overfill it.</p> 

<p>You can also use a pump to inflate the balloon. This will help keep the balloon inflated for longer, as it will be filled with more air and it won't be affected by the temperature of the air. A pump is also much faster and easier than blowing up the balloon with your mouth.</p>
